# Database-prototype
This is a sample Login system, which uses a text file (database.txt) as a database.
It reads/writes the users data (login credentials) from the text file (database.txt)

Python is used to create the GUI, using the tkinter module.
C is used to manage the users login credentials.
Each record in the database.txt is the login credentials of an individual user.
